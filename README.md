Analyses conducted for projects in statistics classes at Harvard University

## Intermediate Statistical Analysis in Psychology (IntermediateStats)
The final project in this course was to analyze real-world data using the methods we learned in class. [Julia Leonard](https://github.com/jlnrd) and I wrote these analyses together. Folder includes:

1) Analysis code, which demonstrates the following methodologies: *chi squared test, linear & mixed models, beta regression, stepwise logistic regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, permutation testing, in addition to data visualization and descriptive methods*.

2) A summary of the results.

## Statistical Learning (AdvancedStats)
This class involved midterm and final projects with a similar directive as above. Julia Leonard was also my partner in this course, but included are only the analysis I conducted for my half of the assignments.

Methodologies used in the midterm: *ordinal regression / proportional odds model, multinomial regression, robust regression, polynomial regression, segmented regression*.

Methodologies used in the final: *cluster analysis, mixture models (including mixed effects mixture model)*.

Both assignments include the analysis code and a descriptive summary of the results.
